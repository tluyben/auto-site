# 🤖 auto-site

A dystopian demonstration of everything wrong with the modern web. This project automatically generates "content" about literally anything, serving as a dark mirror to the current state of the internet where AI-generated articles are slowly replacing human-written content.

## 🎭 What is this?

This is a **satirical project** that generates entire websites about any topic you can imagine. Simply type a topic into the search bar, and watch in horror as it spawns a fully-formed, SEO-optimized article complete with perfectly structured headings, relevant content, and a beautiful layout - all without a single human thought involved in its creation.

## ⚠️ WARNING

This project is a **parody** and should NOT be used for:

- Actual content creation
- SEO optimization
- Running a real website
- Anything that matters

If you're considering using this for real content generation, please stop and reflect on how we got here. This project exists as commentary on the deteriorating state of web content, where quantity trumps quality and AI-generated fluff fills our search results.

## 🛠 Technical Details

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: SQLite3 for storing our AI hallucinations
- **AI**: Groq API for generating content
- **Frontend**: Pure HTML/CSS generated on the fly

- The death of authentic human writing
- The obsession with SEO over substance
- The automation of creativity
- The future we're racing toward without questioning if we should

## 🎭 The Irony

The true irony of this project is that it probably works better than many content farms run by actual humans. That's not a good thing.

## 🤖 Final Note

If you've made it this far and aren't at least a little concerned about the state of web content, you might be part of the problem. This project generates articles that are technically perfect, semantically structured, and utterly soulless - just like an increasing percentage of the modern web.

Remember: Just because we can generate infinite content doesn't mean we should.
